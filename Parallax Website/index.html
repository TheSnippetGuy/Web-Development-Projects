          <b>The New 7 Wonders of the World</b> was a campaign started in 2001
          to choose Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing
          monuments. The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small
          amounts of telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber
          and organized by the New 7 Wonders Foundation (N7W) based in Zurich,
          Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, at
          Estádio da Luz.
          <br />
          <br />
          The poll was considered unscientific partly because it was possible
          for people to cast multiple votes.[6] According to John Zogby, founder
          and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York–based polling
          organization Zogby International, New 7 Wonders Foundation drove "the
          largest poll on record".

          </h2>

        <p class="wonder-info">
          This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the
          world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of
          Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned
          1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”),
          who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22
          years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an
          immense garden with a reflecting pool.<br />
          <br />
          The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious
          stones in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is
          surrounded by four smaller domes. According to some reports, Shah
          Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made out of black marble.
          However, he was deposed by one of his sons before any work began.

          </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="wonder-info">
          Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest
          building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is widely
          thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese
          study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles (21,200 km). Work
          began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. Although
          called a “wall,” the structure actually features two parallel walls
          for lengthy stretches.<br />
          <br />
          In addition, watchtowers and barracks dot the bulwark. One
          not-so-great thing about the wall, however, was its effectiveness.
          Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids, the wall largely
          failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that
          it served more as “political propaganda.”

          </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="wonder-info">
          Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which
          flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe
          Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important
          monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the
          stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24
          meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical
          abilities, the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of
          days in the solar year. <br />
          <br />
          During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts
          shadows on the pyramid that give the appearance of a serpent
          slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head.
          Life there was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home
          to the largest tlachtli (a type of sporting field) in the Americas. On
          that field the residents played a ritual ball game popular throughout
          pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

          </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="wonder-info">
          The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley,
          nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs. It was purported to be
          one of the places where Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth.
          Later the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe, made it their capital, and during
          this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center,
          especially for spices. Noted carvers, the Nabataeans chiseled
          dwellings, temples, and tombs into the sandstone, which changed color
          with the shifting sun. <br />
          <br />
          In addition, they constructed a water system that allowed for lush
          gardens and farming. At its height, Petra reportedly had a population
          of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade routes
          shifted. A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and
          after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned.
          Although rediscovered in 1912, it was largely ignored by
          archaeologists until the late 20th century, and many questions remain
          about the city.

          </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="wonder-info">
          This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram
          Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold
          used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although
          that claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has
          confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of
          the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others
          think that it was likely a pilgrimage site, while some believe it was
          a royal retreat. <br />
          <br />
          What is known is that Machu Picchu is one of the few major
          pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact. Despite its relative
          isolation high in the Andes Mountains, it features agricultural
          terraces, plazas, residential areas, and temples.

          </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="wonder-info">
          Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount
          Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War
          I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They proposed
          a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa,
          Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was
          completed five years later.<br />
          <br />
          The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including
          its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched
          arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the largest Art Deco sculpture in
          the world. Christ the Redeemer is made of rewonder-inforced concrete
          and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Somewhat
          disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in
          2014 the tip of Jesus’s right thumb was damaged during a storm.

          </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="wonder-info">
          The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the
          Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures
          620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of
          vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a
          variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though
          men battling animals was also common.<br />
          <br />
          In addition, water was sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock
          naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians were martyred
          there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. According to some
          estimates, about 500,000 people died in the Colosseum. Additionally,
          so many animals were captured and then killed there that certain
          species reportedly became extinct.
